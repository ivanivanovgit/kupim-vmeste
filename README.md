# Kupim Vmeste

Kupim Vmeste is a service designed for joint purchases (chat on the map) and searching for carpooling vehicles. The service's functionality includes three key tabs: "Chat on the map", "Search for carpooling cars", and "Where to buy", all of which operate without registration. The use of the service is absolutely free.

## Features

### Chat on the Map

This is the main tab of the service where you can exchange messages by placing them on the map. This makes it convenient to unite for joint purchases (group purchases).

### Search for Carpooling Cars

On this tab, you can view or add information about carpooling cars for cargo transportation.

### Where to Buy

Using this tab, you can find the nearest stores, markets, and other sales points that have been verified by users.

## Help/F.A.Q.

In the "Help/F.A.Q." section, you can find detailed instructions for each of the service's tabs. NOTICE: If you experience any issues with the map not loading, try changing your network or disabling VPN. The Yandex.Maps service may block connections from IP addresses not located in Russia.

## Use Case Examples

For instance, if you have become the owner of an apartment in a new complex or a summer house in a garden partnership, you can easily plan a joint purchase (group purchase) of building materials using this service, saving on the delivery of bulky goods.

If you have leftover building materials after renovation that you want to sell, you can post an ad on the "Chat on the map" tab to find those nearby who want to buy them.

For example, if you regularly follow a certain route to work or transport cargo, you can add information about your route on the "Search for carpooling cars" tab and get the opportunity to earn from it.
